    <p>I am so happy to be on this journey.<br> I am on this bootcamp to refresh my skills and hopefully upskill into a higher role in tech.<br> I began my career in IT in 2007 and have been comfortable doing 1st and 2nd line support.<br> I would now like to be more specific in the next role i take.</p>
